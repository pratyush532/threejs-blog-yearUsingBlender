        <h2>My one year doing 3d art in Blender ðŸ¦Š ðŸ‘‘</h2>
        <p>
        </p>
        Today is 27/08/2022 and I started learning Blender about a year ago. 
        I wanted to just talk about my goals, learning experience and pitfalls - so here goes!

        <p>
          My main aim while learning Blender was to make cool art for my music.
          I have since been only using my art in my music.
          The biggest setback I am receiving is that my system can't really handle too much - like too much geometry from subdivision, 
          scattering any object and animation are few things that brick the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          So for a year I have been sticking to static renders with few objects in the environment. Environments are something I am the weakest at so that is where I should improve.
          The feature I was most excited for and which gave me the best results is the geometry nodes.
          I do still need to get much better at it, but I'm loving it so far.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lighting is  I also struggle with. I always default to using cycles, since it looks so good 
          but previewing scenes in the viewport is very hard. Getting a new system for better performance
          won't be happening anywhere in the near future, so I need to find ways to improve content in my scenes
          while keeping it optimized.
        </p>

        <p>
          So for the near future, I will continue to static renders but I want to focus on complementary skills like post
          processing and color correction. I want to learn sculpting and animation, get much better at geometry nodes. I want to learn pixel art.
        </p>

        <p>
          The end goal of learning Blender would be either of the two: 
          <ul>A worldbuilding project</ul>
          <ul>To make a game</ul>
          And here one could be a superset of the other. I hope that I follow through with it  and see a world come to existence.
          This website itself was to see one of the applications of 3d art in web dev using ThreeJS. You can see the jank, but after
          seeing such beautiful portfolio websites where people incorporate their 3d models made in Blender, I too want to do it.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's pretty much it for now. I would like to thank all the creators on youtube for giving their knowledge,
          every addon developer, and every creator who makes assets. You rock and you keep the community alive. I would also
          I like to thank fireship.io for the amazing ThreeJS tutorial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly to every beginner out there, do follow tutorials but try to recreate them in a different way, incorporate your style into it.
          That is how you will be able to level up yout skills.
        </p>
